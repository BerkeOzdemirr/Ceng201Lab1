1.Why can't we rely on CPUexecution to mesaure algorithm efficiency?
Asnwer:CPU execution time depends on hardware, system load, and environment, not just the algorithm itself.

int sum =0;
sum =+sum +5;
1+1 = 2Q(1)
2.How many operations does this code execute ?
Answer:2 operations (an assignment and an addition).

3.Nested loops 
Two nested loops
Divides by n by two
